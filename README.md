## Introduction

This project, initially named "Front End Capstone," has been inherited by the current team for the "System Design Capstone" project. The objective of this project is to optimize the existing system by focusing on one of the following three pathways: Database, Server, or Client-side. This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, and instructions for getting started.

## Project Overview

The original "Front End Capstone" project was developed by another team. The project's purpose and functionality are outlined below:

- Purpose:
  - The original project aimed to create a user-friendly and visually appealing front-end application for a specific use case.
- Functionality:
  - The application provides features such as user authentication, data visualization, data manipulation, and interactive user interfaces.

## System Design Capstone Goals

As the new team working on the "System Design Capstone," the main objective is to optimize the existing project by focusing on one of the following three pathways:

1. Database Optimization:

   - In this pathway, the team will analyze the existing database structure and performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and propose optimizations to improve data storage, retrieval, and overall database performance.

2. Server Optimization:

   - The team will assess the server-side components of the system, including backend APIs, server infrastructure, and performance bottlenecks. The goal is to propose and implement optimizations to enhance server response times, scalability, and resource utilization.

3. Client-side Optimization:
   - This pathway focuses on improving the front-end performance and user experience. The team will analyze the existing user interface, JavaScript code, and network requests to identify areas for improvement. The goal is to optimize rendering, minimize latency, and enhance overall responsiveness.

## Tools and Libraries

To address the optimization goals of the "System Design Capstone" project, the team will utilize the following tools and libraries:

- **K6**: K6 is a load testing tool that can be used to assess the performance and scalability of the system. The team will leverage K6 to simulate various user scenarios, measure response times, and identify potential bottlenecks in the server and client-side components.

- **Faker**: Faker is a library that generates realistic fake data. It will be utilized by the team to generate test data for the database and simulate different user scenarios during load testing. By using Faker, the team can create diverse and meaningful datasets to accurately assess the system's performance.

By combining K6 for load testing and Faker for generating test data, the team will be able to effectively address the optimization goals of the "System Design Capstone" project. These tools will enable them to identify performance bottlenecks, propose optimizations, and enhance the overall performance, scalability, and user experience of the system.
